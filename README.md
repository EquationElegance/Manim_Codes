# ðŸŽ¥ Manim Animations

Welcome! This repository contains the source code for the math and programming animations I share on TikTok.  
They're all built using the [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) engine â€” if you're curious about how they work or want to play around with them, feel free to dive in!

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

To run these animations locally, you'll need the following:

- **Python 3.13.1** (or a compatible version)
- **Manim Community Edition**(https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)
- **manim-rubikscube** (https://manim-rubikscube.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ - if you're using animations involving Rubikâ€™s Cube visualizations)

You can install the required packages with pip:

pip install manim \\
pip install manim-rubikscube
